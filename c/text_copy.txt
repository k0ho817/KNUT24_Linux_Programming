This is Test text file
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eyes
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like the feather
in the beautiful world
I wish I was special
cuz you're so fucking special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
